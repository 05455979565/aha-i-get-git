# Aha! I get Git

üëãüèº Hey friendly face! This is the "Aha! I Get Git!" workshop template. Please use this presentation template for any event where you're introducting Git to your community. Consider forking the repo first, and cloning it down to machine for additional changes.

The slides are brought to you by [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck). Once you install mdx-deck on your machine, you need only update the .mdx file to change the slide content. If you're new to this presentation format, check out [my blog post](https://medium.com/@jsilvafour/a-laymans-guide-to-mdx-decks-36a6b0587095) to learn more.
